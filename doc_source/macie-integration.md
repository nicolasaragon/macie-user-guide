## Integrate Member Accounts with Macie<a name="macie-integration-member"></a>

When you integrate member accounts with Macie you are enabling Macie to monitor resources and activity in these member accounts\. 

**To integrate member accounts with Macie**

1. Log in to AWS with the credentials of the AWS account that you want to integrate with Macie as a member account\.

1. 
**Important**  
This is a required step if you're adding an AWS account as a Macie member account for the first time\.  
You can skip this step if you're re\-adding an AWS account as a Macie member account after disassociating it from Macie\.

   Create the IAM role called `AmazonMacieHandshakeRole` that grants this account the required permissions to be successfully integrated with Macie\. You can create this role by launching the AWS CloudFormation stack templates found at the URLs listed below\. This role only needs to be created once for use in all regions\. For more information about AWS CloudFormation and CloudFormation stacks, see [What is AWS CloudFormation?](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html) and [Working with Stacks](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacks.html)\. 
**Important**  
Make sure to specify the master AWS account ID when running the stack templates below\.
   + US East \(Virginia\): [Macie CloudFormation template for a member account](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/new?stackName=MacieServiceRolesMembers&templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/us-east-1.macie-redirection/cfntemplates/MacieServiceRolesMember.template)
   + US West \(Oregon\): [Macie CloudFormation template for a member account](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-west-2#/stacks/new?stackName=MacieServiceRolesMember&templateURL=https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/us-west-2.macie-redirection/cfntemplates/MacieServiceRolesMember.template)

1. Log in to AWS with the Macie master account, navigate to the Macie console, and then choose the **Integrations** tab\.

1. To integrate a member account, choose the **\+** icon next to **Member accounts**\.

1. In the **Add member AWS account\(s\)** pop up window, enter one or more AWS account IDs\. Separate multiple account numbers with commas\. Choose **Add accounts**\.

**Important**  
Once Macie is enabled in this member account, Macie is assigned a service\-linked role called `AWSServiceRoleForAmazonMacie`\. This service\-linked role includes the permissions and the trust policy that Macie requires to discover, classify, and protect sensitive data in AWS in this account and to generate alerts about potential security issues\. The following are the details of `AWSServiceRoleForAmazonMacie`:

 For more information, see [Using Service\-Linked Roles for Amazon Macie](using-service-linked-roles.md)\. For more information about service\-linked roles, see [Using Service\-Linked Roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html)\. 

If you disable Macie, the service no longer has access to the resources in your member account\. However, the `AmazonMacieHandshakeRole` IAM role that you created for this member account in Step 2 above and the `AWSServiceRoleForAmazonMacie` service\-linked role that was automatically created for this member account when it was integrated with Macie remain intact after you disable Macie\. These existing roles are used again if you decide to re\-enable Macie for this member account\. To re\-enable Macie for a member account, you must use the steps above to integrate this member account with Macie\.

## Specify Data for Macie to Monitor<a name="macie-integration-services"></a>

You can use the **S3 Resources** tab on the **Integrations** page to specify the S3 buckets and prefixes that contain the data that you want Macie to monitor\. 

**Important**  
Currently, Macie can only monitor objects stored in Amazon S3\.

**Important**  
Macie has a default limit on the amount of data that it can classify in an AWS account\. Once this data limit is reached, Macie stops classifying the data in this AWS account\. The default data classification limit is 3TB\. You can contact customer support and request an increase to the default limit\. 

You can also specify S3 buckets and prefixes for Macie to monitor during the initial Macie setup\. For more information and instructions, see [Setting Up Amazon Macie](macie-setting-up.md)\.

1. Log in to AWS with the credentials of the AWS account that is serving as your Macie master account\.

1. In the Macie console's **Integrations** tab, choose the **S3 Resources** tab\. 

1. In the **S3 Resources** tab, select the account id \(master or member\) in the **Select an account** drop\-down and then choose **Select**\.

1. On the **Integrate S3 resources with Macie** page, choose either **Edit** to edit the buckets/prefixes that are already integrated with Macie or **Add** to select new buckets/prefixes to integrate with Macie\. 
**Note**  
You can select up to 250 S3 buckets and prefixes\. You can only select S3 buckets in your current AWS region\.

1. Next, you must configure the methods for classifying your new and existing S3 objects\. The continuous classification method is applied to new objects that are added or updated after your buckets selection is complete\. Continuous classification of new data enables S3 object\-level logging for all selected buckets and prefixes\. The one\-time classification method is applied only once to all of the existing objects in the selected S3 buckets/prefixes\.
**Important**  
In the current Macie release, you can only select **Full** as the setting for the continuous classification \(classifying new objects\) and you can select **Full** or **None** as the settings for the one\-time classification method \(classifying all existing objects\)\.
**Important**  
If you enable one\-time classification, note the following values that are displayed for each selected bucket/prefix:  
Total objects \- total number of objects in this S3 bucket/prefix\.
Processed estimate \- total size of the data from this bucket that Macie will actually classify\. 
Cost estimate \- the cost estimate for classifying objects within this bucket\.
Macie also provides you with several totals for all of the selected buckets:  
**Total size** \- total size of the data within all of the selected buckets\.
**Total number of objects** \- total number of objects in all of the selected S3 buckets\.
**Processed estimate** \- total size of the data from all of the selected buckets that Macie will actually classify\. 
**Total cost estimate** \- the total content classification cost estimate for all selected buckets\.
The **Total cost estimate** for each bucket is based on the **Processed estimate** value for that bucket and the general Macie pricing of $5 per GB processed by the content classification engine\. The total cost estimates are provided only for S3 buckets, not for prefixes\. For more information, see [Amazon Macie Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/macie/pricing/)\.   
The **Processed estimate** value for each bucket is calculated as follows:  
If an object's size is less than 1KB, 1KB is added to the **Processed estimate** value\. Otherwise, the object's actual size is added to the **Processed estimate** value\.
If the object's size is greater than 20MB, 20MB is added to the ** Processed estimate** value\. Otherwise, the object's actual size is added to the **Processed estimate** value\.
For object in Amazon Glacier vaults, 0 is added to the ** Processed estimate** value\.
Note that it is possible for the **Processed estimate** value of an S3 bucket to be higher than the **Total size** value\.  
Note that the one\-time classification cost estimates are only calculated per S3 buckets and NOT per S3 bucket prefixes\. If you select an S3 bucket prefix, the cost estimate for the entire S3 bucket is included in the total cost estimate summary for the selected resources\. If you select multiple prefixes of the same S3 bucket, the cost estimate for this entire S3 bucket is included only once in the total cost estimate summary for the selected resources\.

1. When you've finished your selections, choose **Review**\.

1. When you've finished reviewing your selections, choose **Start classification**\.

## Encrypted Objects<a name="macie-encrypted-objects"></a>

If objects stored in your Amazon S3 buckets are encrypted, Macie might not be able to read and classify those objects: 
+ If your Amazon S3 objects are encrypted using [Amazon S3\-managed encryption keys \(SSE\-S3\)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html), Macie can read and classify the objects using the roles created during the setup process\.
+ If your Amazon S3 objects are encrypted using [AWS KMS\-managed keys \(SSE\-KMS\)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html), Macie can read and classify the objects only if you add the `AWSMacieServiceCustomerServiceRole` IAM role or the `AWSServiceRoleForAmazonMacie` service\-linked role as a [key user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html#key-policy-default-allow-users) for the KMS customer master key \(CMK\)\. If you don't add either of these roles as a key user for the KMS CMK, Macie cannot read and classify the objects\. However, Macie still stores metadata on the object, including which KMS CMK was used to protect the object\.
+ If your Amazon S3 objects are encrypted using client\-side encryption, Macie cannot read and classify the objects, but still stores metadata on the object\.
